WAV File Format
===============

This is my attempt to (completely?) document the .WAV file format.

Unfortunately, there isn't a single authoritative source for the .WAV file format.  It's easy to
save and load 16-bit mono/stereo samples, but there's a lot of extra hocus pocus hidden for anything
more than that.
